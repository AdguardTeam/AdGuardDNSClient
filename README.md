1. Download and unpack the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` archive from the [releases page][releases].

2. Install it as a service by running:

    ```sh
    ./AdGuardDNSClient -s install -v
    ```

3. Edit the configuration file `config.yaml`.

4. Start the service:

    ```sh
    ./AdGuardDNSClient -s start -v
    ```

To check that it works, use any DNS checking utility. For example, using `nslookup`:

```sh
nslookup -debug 'www.example.com' '127.0.0.1'
```

You will need Go 1.22 or later. First, register our pre-commit hooks:

```sh
make init
```

Then, install the necessary tools and dependencies:

```sh
make go-deps go-tools
```

Thatâ€™s pretty much it! You should now be able to lint, test, and build the `AdGuardDNSClient` binary:

```sh
make go-lint
make go-test
make go-build
```

For building packages, you might need additional tools, such as GnuPG, MSI Tools (v0.103 and later), etc.  See `./scripts/make/build-release.sh`.

## <a href="#opts" id="opts" name="opts">Command-line options</a>

Any option overrides the corresponding value provided by configuration file.

### <a href="#opts-service" id="opts-service" name="opts-service">Service</a>

Option `-s <value>` specifies the OS service action. Possible values are:

- `install`: installs AdGuard DNS Client as a service;
- `restart`: restarts the running AdGuard DNS Client service.
- `start`: starts the installed AdGuard DNS Client service;
- `status`: shows the status of the installed AdGuard DNS Client service;
- `stop`: stops the running AdGuard DNS Client;
- `uninstall`: uninstalls AdGuard DNS Client service;

### <a href="#opts-verbose" id="opts-verbose" name="opts-verbose">Verbose</a>

Option `-v` enables the verbose log output.

## <a href="#conf" id="conf" name="conf">Configuration</a>

### <a href="#conf-file" id="conf-file" name="conf-file">File</a>

The YAML configuration file is described in the [`doc/configuration.md`] file,
and there is also a sample configuration file `config.dist.yaml`.  Some
configuration parameters can also be overridden using the environment, see
[`doc/environment.md`].

[`doc/configuration.md`]: doc/configuration.md
[`doc/environment.md`]:   doc/environment.md

## <a href="#exit-codes" id="exit-codes" name="exit-codes">Exit codes</a>

There are a bunch of different error codes that may appear under different error
conditions:

- `0`: AdGuardDNSClient successfully finished and exited, no errors.

- `1`: Internal error, most probably misconfiguration.

- `2`: Bad command-line argument or its value.
