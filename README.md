### <a href="#start-basic-unix" id="start-basic-unix" name="start-basic-unix">Unix-like</a>

1. Download and unpack the `.tar.gz` or `.zip` archive from the [releases page][releases].

    > [!WARNING]
    > On macOS, it's crucial that globally installed daemons are owned by `root` (see the [`launchd` documentation][launchd-requirements]), so the `AdGuardDNSClient` executable must be placed in the `/Applications/` directory or its subdirectory.

2. Install it as a service by running:

    ```sh
    ./AdGuardDNSClient -s install -v
    ```

3. Edit the configuration file `config.yaml`.

4. Start the service:

    ```sh
    ./AdGuardDNSClient -s start -v
    ```

To check that it works, use any DNS checking utility. For example, using `nslookup`:

```sh
nslookup -debug 'www.example.com' '127.0.0.1'
```

### <a href="#start-basic-win" id="start-basic-win" name="start-basic-win">Windows</a>

Just download and install using the MSI installer from the [releases page][releases].

To check that it works, use any DNS checking utility. For example, using `nslookup.exe`:

```sh
nslookup -debug "www.example.com" "127.0.0.1"
```

### <a href="#dev-start" id="dev-start" name="dev-start">Development quick start</a>

You will need Go 1.22 or later. First, register our pre-commit hooks:

```sh
make init
```

Then, install the necessary tools and dependencies:

```sh
make go-deps go-tools
```

Thatâ€™s pretty much it! You should now be able to lint, test, and build the `AdGuardDNSClient` binary:

```sh
make go-lint
make go-test
make go-build
```

For building packages, you might need additional tools, such as GnuPG, MSI Tools (v0.103 and later), etc. See `./scripts/make/build-release.sh`.

## <a href="#opts" id="opts" name="opts">Command-line options</a>

Each option overrides the corresponding value provided by the configuration file and the environment.

### <a href="#opts-help" id="opts-help" name="opts-help">Help</a>

Option `-h` makes AdGuard DNS Client print out a help message to standard output and exit with a success status-code.

### <a href="#opts-service" id="opts-service" name="opts-service">Service</a>

Option `-s <value>` specifies the OS service action. Possible values are:

- `install`: installs AdGuard DNS Client as a service;
- `restart`: restarts the running AdGuard DNS Client service.
- `start`: starts the installed AdGuard DNS Client service;
- `status`: shows the status of the installed AdGuard DNS Client service;
- `stop`: stops the running AdGuard DNS Client;
- `uninstall`: uninstalls AdGuard DNS Client service;

### <a href="#opts-verbose" id="opts-verbose" name="opts-verbose">Verbose</a>

Option `-v` enables the verbose log output.

### <a href="#opts-version" id="opts-version" name="opts-version">Version</a>

Option `--version` makes AdGuard DNS Client print out the version of the `AdGuardDNSClient` executable to standard output and exit with a success status-code.

## <a href="#conf" id="conf" name="conf">Configuration</a>

The YAML configuration file is described in [its own article][conf], and there is also a sample configuration file `config.dist.yaml`.  Some configuration parameters can also be overridden using the [environment][env].

[env]:  https://adguard-dns.io/kb/dns-client/environment/

## <a href="#exit-codes" id="exit-codes" name="exit-codes">Exit codes</a>

There are a few different exit codes that may appear under different error conditions:

- `0`: Successfully finished and exited, no errors.

- `1`: Internal error, most likely a misconfiguration.

- `2`: Bad command-line argument or value.
